**What is CourtBot?**<br>
COURTBOT is a text-message app that helps keep everything on track. After cases are booked, clients can text their case number to COURTBOT to receive automatic reminders of court dates. Research shows that reminders work.<br>

Why CourtBot?<br>

LESS BUREAUCRACY<br>
Around 25% of the people in Tulsa County Jail are waiting for their cases to be heard, costing taxpayers up to $25,000 per day. When clients attend their court cases, more small fines are collected, and jail space is freed for more serious offenders. Remembering to attend court can help break the cycle of fines and jail time.<br>


FEWER FINES<br>
Failure-to-appear and failure-to-pay fines can quickly snowball, especially for those living paycheck-to-paycheck. CourtBot helps clients avoid mistakes that burden them and the criminal justice system. Government done well can help.<br>

Problem
The B.C. Franklin Legal Clinic (BCFLC) launched in the Spring semester of the 2021-2022 school year. The clinic was established by the TU College of Law to serve the North Tulsa area, where there are few law firms, and access to legal services is very challenging for community members. Currently located in the same building as the university’s immigration clinic, eventually the B.C. Franklin Legal Clinic will find a location in North Tulsa, so that it can better serve clients where they are.Clinic organizers worked with students during the first semester of the program on legal cases surrounding housing; the many acute challenges renters in Tulsa face, including the city’s high eviction rate (Tulsa’s eviction rate is the 11th highest in the nation).In addition the clinic’s students (16) studied the historical and systemic legal issues that are at the root of disparities in housing between north (demographically majority Black) and south (demographically majority white) Tulsa.

Solution
Now is the perfect opportunity to introduce Courtbot—a text messaging-based service that keeps justice-involved folks informed about updates to their case. In working with community members on their legal cases, students can also use Courtbot as a tool to serve their clients. At the same time, Code for Tulsa and BCFLC can better understand the needs of Courtbot users. In addition, BCFLC can help us measure Courtbot’s current and potential future impact. In this way, Courtbot can be studied and we can document its impact, while the service is used by a greater number of people in the community. BCFLC benefits by (1) giving students & their clients a way to keep track of court case updates, and (2) giving students research & publishing opportunities.
